**Degradation of geotextiles of *Typha latifolia* Linn used in soil bioengineering techniques**

**CERTO ABSTRACT**

The use of taboa fibers (Typha latifolia Linn), for geotextile manufacturing, was designed to stabilize riverbanks or slopes and to create an ecologically suitable environment for the recovery of vegetation and soil anchoring. The objective of this work was to evaluate the resistance of geotextiles manufactured from taboa fibers submitted to accelerate aging in the laboratory and degradation of these fibers in the field. The geotextile manufacturing was performed with different knots in fibers that had previously undergone different drying processes. To perform the tests in the laboratory, an apparatus that allowed the geotextile to be subjected to premature aging was built, seeking to simulate the environmental conditions. The fibers were exposed to UVB radiation followed by condensation, using also a mechanical cooler, for temperature equalization. The tensile strength tests followed the guidelines observed in the ISO 10319 (1996) and ISO 12236 (1998) Brazilian National Standards. The field trials were conducted by placing samples on a slope on the right bank of the São Francisco river in the municipality of Amparo do São Francisco, Sergipe state, 10°08'20.7"S 36°54'47.0"W, Northeaster Brazil, with 20m<sup>2</sup> area, under local climatic conditions, for further evaluation of their degradation. Since the materials are not homogeneous in their manufacture, non-uniform results occurred when subjected to degradation. This may explain the fact that unexpected increases in stress and strain values were observed. The taboa geotextile showed results of rupture stress and deformation that signals positively for its commercial use, thus confirming its potential for use as part of soil bioengineering techniques.

**CERTO RESUMO**

O uso das fibras da taboa (Typha latifolia Linn), para confecção de geotêxteis, tem sido trabalhada, buscando a estabilização de taludes de rios ou encostas, e assim criando um ambiente ecologicamente favorável para a recuperação da vegetação e a ancoragem do solo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a resistência e durabilidade de geotêxteis fabricados com fibras da taboa submetidos ao envelhecimento acelerado em laboratório e degradação dessas fibras em campo. A confecção dos geotêxteis foi realizada com diferentes nós em fibras que passaram previamente por processos de secagem distintos. Para a realização dos testes em laboratório, foi construído aparato que permitiu submeter os corpos de prova ao envelhecimento precoce, buscando simulação das condições ambientais, isto é, as fibras foram expostas à radiação UVB seguida de condensação, utilizando-se também um resfriador mecânico para equalização da temperatura. Os ensaios de resistência à tração seguiram diretrizes observadas nas normas ISO 10319 (1996) e ISO 12236 (1998). Os ensaios de campo foram conduzidos por disposição de amostras em um talude da margem direita do rio São Francisco no município de Amparo do São Francisco-SE, 10°08'20.7"S 36°54'47.0"W, Nordeste do Brazil, com área de 20m<sup>2</sup>, submetidas às condições climáticas locais, para posterior avaliação da sua degradação. Uma vez que os materiais não apresentam homogeneidade na sua fabricação, ocorreram resultados não uniformes quando submetidos à degradação. Isso pode explicar o fato de serem observados aumentos inesperados nos valores de tensão e deformação. O geotêxteis de taboa apresentou resultados de tensão de ruptura e deformação que sinaliza positivamente para o seu uso comercial, confirmando, assim, as suas potencialidades para uso como parte das técnicas de bioengenharia de solos. 

**CERTO SEGUNDO PARÁGRAFO INTRODUÇÃO**

The use of geotextiles combined with recognized viability technologies offers a great advantage in protecting the soil, mostly recognized as the low cost when compared to other techniques of traditional engineering (FUGGINI *et al*., 2016)track and substructure represents 50-60% of the total costs of such infrastructure over its entire service life. Innovations in track and substructure are therefore fundamental to achieve a significant impact on the overall cost reduction for the railways. Therefore new solutions for track improvements that are effective and that can minimize the interruption of traffic are needed. Moreover, failures of railway embankments happened recently in different regions of the world. Such events, such as the one happened in UK in February 2013 (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-21441070. According to Holanda *et al*. (2009) and Broda *et al*.(2018), Geotextiles promote immediate protection against soil erosion, characterized in that programmable degradation as well as they provide speed in the revegetation process, a situation that allows potential reduction of erosion.

**CERTO TERCEIRO PARÁGRAFO INTRODUÇÃO**

The occurrence of low availability of geotextiles made from natural fibers on the market, is restricted to a few species production, almost exclusively made from fibers extracted from coconut (*Cocos nucifera* L.) as well, sisal (*Agave sisalana* Perrine) (Desai DESAI and Kant KANT (2016) and Kenaf (*Hibiscus cannabinus*) (SHIRAZI SHIRAZI *et al*. (2019).

**CERTO NONO PARAGRÁFO INTRODUÇÃO**

There is an urgent demand for research on new plant fibers applied to the production of geotextiles with high efficiency and durability as well as proven protective action and soil cover, from renewable sources and low cost, to compose soil bioengineering techniques (EMBRAPA, 2014), as well as instruments that make possible the measurement of its strength, considering the possibility of operating materials from fibers of native species, with availability for sustainable use. The sustainable extraction of plant fibers, combined with studies related to the production of geotextiles, as well as improvements in the technical apparatus for aging or degradation, is presented as a technological innovation that comes with great contribution in the studies about erosion control and natural resource conservation on riverbanks or slopes (SAHA *et al*., 2012). The objective of this work was to evaluate the resistance of geotextiles manufactured from taboa fibers submitted to accelerate aging in the laboratory and the degradation of these fibers in the field.

**CERTO PRIMEIRO PARÁGRAFO MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS**

Geotextiles used in this work were manufactured from taboa fibers (*Typha latifolia* Linn.), a very common plant in the lowlands of the lower São Francisco River, state of Sergipe, that the also known as cattail local riverine communities regularly use in the manufacture of various utensils or crafts such as baskets, mats, bags, woven sandals among others (Figure 1A and B).

**QUINTO PARÁGRAFO MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS**

**Accelerated aging of the geotextile**

The accelerated aging test promoted the acceleration of the mechanisms responsible for the degradation of fibers from a built equipment which simulated the field's environmental conditions, in predetermined cycles. This aging or degradation chamber was built in the Erosion and Sedimentation LaboratoryLaboratório de Erosão e Sedimentação (LABES), at 'Universidade Federal de Sergipe' (UFS), based in an equipment currently used for geo-synthetics previously tested by Silveira (2009). A registered background related to technological development and innovation on this subject is in the first experiments or tests conducted with the use of available geotextiles in the market, made from coconut fibers and sisal fibers, provided by manufacturers.

**CERTO SEXTO PARÁGRAFO MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS**

It was possible to build a simple unit, even unpatented yet, to test the acceleration and the degradation of these materials in laboratory conditions, with innovations in the apparatus previously built. Some parameters were observed for the construction of this apparatus, such as type of lamp to be used as a radiation source as well as the arrangement where the material to be subjected to testing should be placed. The choice of the right lamp was made according to the type of radiation to be simulated in order to promote the geotextile degradation. The operation of the geotextile accelerated the aging equipment was made in accordance made in accordance with the methodology explained by Saron and Leite (2001), who used to test a material made with carbon fiber, a UVB radiation followed by condensation (cycles), also using a cooler to cool the temperature.

**CERTO OITAVO PARÁGRAFO MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS**

**Degradation and Aging Tests of Geotextiles**

According to Balogh *et al*. (2011), the degradation was conducted associated with aging of geotextiles in the laboratory using test samples prepared with dimensions of 20 cm width and 50 cm in length, obtained in a longitudinal direction of manufactured geotextilegeotextile manufactured. Among the total quantity of tested samples, five were kept intact, which acted as blank samples, without any degradation procedure.

**CERTO DÉCIMO PRIMEIRO PARÁGRAFO DE MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS**

In order to test the degradation under field conditions, the samples were placed on a slope of the right bank of São Francisco River in its lower course, located in the municipality of Amparo São Francisco, SE state, with geographic coordinates 36°50'25.335"W and 10°13'34,081"S. The selected area has been tested with soil bioengineering techniques for slope stabilization, which evaluated the effect of degradation of environmental factors of the studied material. The used geotextile covered the slope in an area of 20 m<sup>2,</sup> according to the standard procedure with this material in the field. Five samples were collected in the programed time, occurring in the central part of the slope, through six months.

**CERTO DESCIMO QUARTO PARÁGRAFO DE MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS**

For conducting tensile tests intact sample were takenwere taken intact samples, the ones which have not undergone any kind of degradation by the presented processes, and geotextiles samples which have undergone degradation in the field as well as the samples which have went through acceleration processes in the laboratory degradation. The samples after the drying processes were subjected to mechanical tests in order to test their resistances as shown in Table 2.

**CERTO TERCEIRO PARÁGRAFO DE RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO**

There was a decrease of about 58.83% of T0 to T2 and it returned to near the value T0 from the treatment T3/31,78N (Figure 4) but when analyzed in the average rank, through Simes-Hochberg method, there was no statistical difference between treatments in different sampling times. This reduction in resistance seems to be a result of UV radiation, probably the same behavior found in the results of (CarneiroCARNEIRO, Almeida ALMEIDA and Lopes LOPES, (2019) which induced the application of UV rays in the laboratory using polypropylene geo-grids during 42 days. This effect may be due to a significant acceleration of the fibers oxidation resulting in a drop in its resistance. Fibers from taboa plant, are very much suitable to the occurrence of oxidative actions on both pH different levels (GHOSH *et al*., 2019) and under UV radiation incidence Carneiro; Almeida and Lopes (2019). Currently studies have declined the production of compounds that prevent such degrading agents (MIDHA; JOSHI; SURESH KUMAR, 2017; THAKUR *et al*., 2019).

**CERTO QUARTO PARÁGRAFO DE RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO**

The involved mechanism decreasemechanism involved decrease in the mechanical resistance with aging, allowed allowing a perception of slight decays in the values, although not statistically different, in all tested levels (Figure 4), even though we found a strong deviation of the quartiles data in 120 days sampling.

**CERTO SEXTO PARÁGRAFO DE RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO**

The elevated values of interquartile range for deformation analyses of the tested samples indicated low homogeneity of the tested and braided geotextilegeotextile tested and braided, which was not uniform, with different strips thickness. For the rupture resistance the interquartile range presented high levels in the early days of the experiment (T1) regulating over the sampling time (Figure 5).

**CERTO OITAVO PARÁGRAFO DE RESULTADOS E DISCUSSÃO**

The results of Araújo-Filho, Holanda and Andrade (2013) evaluating coconut fiber (400 Fibrax BF) geotextile, showed tension strength results for the non-degraded material and degraded ones at 60 and 90 days, of 0.31 and 0.13 (kN / m<sup>2</sup>) and to deformation of 21.78% and 15.64%, respectively. These findings are close to what was found in this work, showing that the taboa was recorded fiber has good resistance to rupture, showing a strong potential to use in soil bioengineering works.

**CERTO QUARTO TÓPICO DA CONCLUSÃO** 

Compared to commercial synthetic geotextiles subjected to the same experimental conditions, the taboa geotextilegeotextile taboa obtained favorable results related to tension strength and deformation, thus confirming its potential for using it in soil bioengineering works.
