# Modeling the Degradation Kinetics of Natural Geotextiles: The Role of Lignin/Cellulose Ratio

## 1. Introduction

The global imperative for sustainable infrastructure has driven a paradigm shift in geotechnical engineering, moving from exclusive reliance on synthetic geosynthetics to the adoption of nature-based solutions. While polymeric geotextiles—primarily derived from polypropylene and polyester—offer high tensile strength and durability, their persistence in the environment contributes to the accumulation of microplastics and carbon emissions [@Koerner2016; @Sanjay2019]. In contrast, natural fiber geotextiles (NFGs) present a renewable, biodegradable alternative that aligns with circular economy principles [@Pazhanivelan2025; @Karimah2021].

However, the widespread application of NFGs is constrained by a "durability paradox": the very biodegradability that makes them ecologically desirable also limits their service life in critical stabilization functions [@Ingrassia2020]. The degradation kinetics of lignocellulosic fibers are highly sensitive to environmental stressors, particularly ultraviolet (UV) radiation and moisture cycles, which attack the amorphous regions of cellulose and hemicellulose [@Sathishkumar2022; @Akter2020].

Among the promising candidates for NFGs, *Typha domingensis* (cattail) and *Boehmeria nivea* (ramie) represent two distinct structural archetypes. *Typha*, an abundant macrophyte in tropical wetlands, offers high biomass availability but is often considered an invasive species [@Grace1989; @Manning2018]. *Ramie*, known for its superior mechanical properties, is widely cultivated for textile applications [@Reinhardt2022]. The fundamental difference between these fibers lies in their biochemical composition, specifically the lignin/cellulose (L/C) ratio, which dictates their resistance to photo-oxidative and hydrolytic degradation [@Holanda2024; @Silveira2021].

Previous studies have explored various chemical treatments to enhance the durability of natural fibers, with alkaline treatment (mercerization) being the most common [@Gurunathan2015; @Tanasa2022]. However, a comprehensive understanding of how the L/C ratio interacts with surface treatments to modulate degradation rates under accelerated aging conditions remains a critical gap in the literature [@Amiandamhen2020; @Chunyuk2023].

This study addresses this gap by investigating the degradation kinetics of *Typha* and *Ramie* fibers subjected to accelerated UV aging. By correlating the L/C ratio with mechanical property retention (tensile strength) and surface morphological changes, we aim to establish a predictive model for the service life of these NFGs. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of optimized alkaline treatments in extending the functional lifespan of these materials, providing a scientific basis for their engineering design in soil bioengineering applications.
